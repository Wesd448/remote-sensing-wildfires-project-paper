## Project Overview

Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, property, and human lives. In our project, we focused on assessing the impact of wildfires in Los Angeles, a region known for its diverse landscapes and climatic conditions. We utilized remote sensing techniques to gather data, analyze climatic patterns, and develop risk maps to aid in wildfire management.

This repository contains all the materials from our project, including reports, a research paper submitted for publication, presentations, and posters. You can find the complete list of releases [here](https://github.com/Wesd448/remote-sensing-wildfires-project-paper/releases).

## Key Topics

Our project covers several important topics related to wildfires and remote sensing:

- **Climatic Patterns**: Understanding the weather conditions that contribute to wildfire occurrences.
- **Forests**: Analyzing the types of forests affected by wildfires.
- **GIS**: Using Geographic Information Systems for spatial analysis and mapping.
- **Impact Analysis**: Evaluating the effects of wildfires on the environment and communities.
- **Los Angeles**: Focusing on the unique challenges and risks in this urban area.
- **Remote Sensing**: Employing satellite imagery and aerial data for assessment.
- **Risk Mapping**: Creating visual representations of wildfire risk zones.
- **Terrain Analysis**: Studying the physical landscape and its influence on fire behavior.
- **Wildfire Management**: Strategies for preventing and responding to wildfires.

## Project Deliverables

The repository includes the following deliverables:

- **Research Paper**: A detailed study submitted for publication.
- **Reports**: Comprehensive documents outlining our methodology and findings.
- **Presentations**: PowerPoint slides summarizing our project.
